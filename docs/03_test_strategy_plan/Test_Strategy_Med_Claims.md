\## Medical Claims Validation Portal – Phase 1



\### 1. Objective

The objective of this test strategy is to define the overall testing approach for the Medical Claims Validation Portal. The goal is to ensure that all functional and non-functional requirements are validated and the system behaves correctly under normal and negative scenarios.
